    "The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies across sectors such as healthcare, manufacturing, and agriculture has increased dependence on continuous network connectivity and large-scale data exchange. This expanded connectivity significantly enlarges the attack surface, making IoT devices attractive targets for cybercriminals who can exploit vulnerable endpoints to compromise other systems operating within the same network infrastructure (Sharmila and Nagapadma, 2023). The financial consequences of such attacks continue to escalate. According to the IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2025, the global average cost of a data breach is USD 4.44 million, reflecting the persistent economic impact of increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, particularly those involving AI-driven and ungoverned systems (IBM Security, 2025). High-profile incidents further demonstrate the severity of these risks. In 2021, the Verkada breach exposed live video feeds from approximately 150 million surveillance cameras, while another attack in the same year enabled an adversary to manipulate chemical levels at a water treatment facility in Florida. These incidents highlight the growing prevalence and potential consequences of anomaly-based cyberattacks within IoT infrastructures, underscoring the urgent need for robust and efficient anomaly detection mechanisms as IoT deployments continue to expand (Sharmila and Nagapadma, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to replicate and extend the findings of Sharmila and Nagapadma (2023) by evaluating the effectiveness of autoencoder-based anomaly detection for identifying malicious activity in IoT network traffic. Building on their approach, we focus on systematic model selection, rigorous evaluation of predictive and generalization performance, and interpretation of the relationship between learned representations and key traffic features. Given the heterogeneity of IoT network behavior and the variability in traffic patterns across devices, anomaly detection requires models capable of learning device-specific normal behavior. Consistent with prior work, we employ autoencoder architectures trained exclusively on benign network traffic, under the assumption that anomalous traffic will yield higher reconstruction error. The analysis is conducted using real-time IoT network traffic collected from four representative devices—ThingSpeak-LED, MQTT-Temp, Amazon Alexa, and Wipro Bulb—allowing us to assess model robustness across diverse IoT operating profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent intrusion detection systems (IDS) for IoT environments increasingly adopt unsupervised learning approaches, particularly anomaly detection, to identify rare deviations from normal network behavior. As summarized by Sharmila and Nagapadma (2023), this paradigm is especially important in IoT infrastructures, where anomalous activity can lead to severe operational and environmental consequences. However, the authors note that progress in this area has been constrained by the limited availability of realistic IoT-specific network traffic datasets, which complicates reliable anomaly detection. To address this challenge, their study emphasizes the generation and use of network traces collected from real-time IoT devices that capture both benign and attack behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharmila and Nagapadma (2023) further highlight that deploying AI-based IDS frameworks on IoT devices presents significant challenges due to constrained computational resources, including limited memory, processing capability, and energy availability. As a result, conventional deep learning models are often impractical without optimization. Their work underscores the importance of model optimization techniques—such as network pruning and numerical quantization—to reduce model size and computational overhead while preserving detection performance. These strategies enable more efficient inference, lower energy consumption, and improved feasibility of deploying anomaly detection models on resource-constrained IoT devices."

    "The RT-IoT2022, a proprietary dataset derived from a real-time IoT infrastructure, is introduced as a comprehensive resource integrating a diverse range of IoT devices and sophisticated network attack methodologies. This dataset encompasses both normal and adversarial network behaviours, providing a general representation of real-world scenarios. Incorporating data from IoT devices such as ThingSpeak-LED, Wipro-Bulb, and MQTT-Temp, as well as simulated attack scenarios involving Brute-Force SSH attacks, DDoS attacks using Hping and Slowloris, and Nmap patterns, RT-IoT2022 offers a detailed perspective on the complex nature of network traffic. The bidirectional attributes of network traffic are meticulously captured using the Zeek network monitoring tool and the Flowmeter plugin. Researchers can leverage the RT-IoT2022 dataset to advance the capabilities of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), fostering the development of robust and adaptive security solutions for real-time IoT networks.\n",
